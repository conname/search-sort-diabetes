# "Search & Sort Algorithm Implementation (Diabetes Dataset)"

  The purpose of this project is to create a system that loads, searches, and sorts data from a CSV file which contains a table of patients health information related to diabetes. This project helps users efficiently organize and search from diabetes-related health records through searching and sorting functions in Python. It also serves as an educational tool for understanding and comparing different search and sorting algorithms in a practical scenario.
